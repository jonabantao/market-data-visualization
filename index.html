        As of February 2018, the American stock market 
        has been in a bull market for a consecutive nine years. While the S&P500
        has risen approximately <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/sandp_500_5_year_return">89%</a> in five years,
        the NASDAQ-100 has risen almost twice as high, having a total return of almost 
        <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/indices/nasdaq-total-returns.aspx">156%</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chart uses the D3.js library to show selected companies and their
        performance up to the past five years. All data is pulled from the 
        <a href="https://iextrading.com/developer/">IEX Developer API</a>. Bubbles
        are sized according to their price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). For fundamental
        investors, a larger P/E generally means purchasing a share of a company 
        is relatively expensive compared to one with a low P/E.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that there are some companies listed on the chart with a P/E ratio of
        "Not Applicable". Not Applicable P/E ratios are negative mainly from reporting
        a loss in earnings per share.
