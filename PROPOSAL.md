# Background
This project is a data visualization of selected companies' stock market performance starting at the beginning of the American recovery from the Great Recession. 

# MVPs
- [ ] Display of the main graph showing selected companies, X-axis for their market capitialization, Y-axis for the rate of return.
- [ ] Bubbles for each company scale with their trailing P/E ratio.
- [ ] Bubbles are clickable and will show a modal of the companies information.



## Bonus
- [ ] Have the graph show the growth (or loss) of a company's market cap and rate of return. Similiar to how the [Wealth and Health of Nations](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/) graph works.
